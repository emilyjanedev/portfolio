# Emily Schur - Developer Portfolio

Check out the live site: [Link]()

A website to showcase my projects and dive into small coding explorations.

For this first iteration of my portfolio, I wanted to learn and implement some new technologies. I thought this simple and small scale project would be a good place to practice them.

Using TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind for this project really helped me build a foundational knowledge of these tools. I look forward to implementing them into more complex projects in the future.
